## ðŸŒ  About
The Tale of the Dying Sun is my dream game in development just by me. It takes inspiration from some of my favorite games: Shadow of the Colossus, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Dark Souls. The game is set in one of the last solar systems of a dying universe, where the main character wakes up in an empty chamber, seemingly one of the last of their kind.

As the mysterious and lonely character, the player is free to explore the solar system and find answers to the questions that arise. The game is minimalist, allowing the player to decide what to do next.
